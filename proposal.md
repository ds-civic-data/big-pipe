Theme: How effective has the big pipe project been in improving the water quality of the Willamette river? What has the change in water quality before and after the project? 

Specific Questions:

(i) How can we model CSOs by linking occurence of CSOs with precipitation data? Can we build a predictive model based on historical data?

(ii) What is the best measure of water quality for the Willamette river (e.g. e coli counts)? Can we track this month by month over a period of years? How can we measure impact of CSOs on water quality of Willamette river? 

(iii) How to best convey information on water quality for Willamette river to public? 

Stakeholders:

(i) Taffy Spencer (503-823-7283) (at City of Portland)

(ii) Portland Bureau of Environmental Services

(iii) Oregon Department of Environmental Quality 

(iv) Johnston Creek Watershed Council: Daniel Newberg

Description of Data: 

We need several forms of data to complete this project. 

First is data on CSO occurence. Form we want is when CSO occured,  where overflow was and where flowed into, duration of CSO, estimation of amount of water that flowed into Willamette and tributaries. This data would likely come from Portland's Bureau of Environmental Services.

Also need preciptation data for dates on which CSO's occured (at the very least, more data is better). Prefer preciptation data that is as spatially disaggregated as possible so as to match sites where CSOs can occur from with where rainfall was. Want amount of preciptation preceding and during CSO event. This data would come from NWS or Weather Underground likely. 

Need to figure out if there is a way to obtain good e-coli sampling data, or some other measure of water quality on the Willamette. This data might come from Portland BES or from Oregon DEQ, other sources will also be explored. 

There could be confidentiality concerns, although likely no privacy concerns as there will be no human subjects involved in the data we analyze. 

For deliverable, we are looking to create models that capture the relationship of CSO occurence and severity with the Willamette river health. Also will possibly making maps which visualize from where CSOs occur. Format of deliverable will be a white paper Rmd document delivered on the repository.
