Below is an overview of what makes water quality, by European water standards, standards that we should at least look at, if not adhere to :

**Aluminum** : negative

-   effects : pose danger to persons suffering from kidney disorders, and causes neurological disorders

-   usage : the compound aluminium sulphate ("alum") is very widely used in water treatment to remove colour and non-filtrable matter in raw waters.

-   metrics : recommended levels around

**Ammonia** : indicator

-   effects : indicates possibility of sewage pollution and consequent possible presence of pathogenic micro-organisms

-   usage : N/A

-   metrics : used in conjunction with chloride, because both are present in significant quantities in sewage. typical levels around 0.3 mg/L (limiting amount)

**Antimony** : indicator

-   effects : indicaates possible pollution from metal industry

-   usage : naturally occurring trace element used in metal industry and in flame retardant materials.

-   metrics : typical level around 1 ug/L

**Barium** : negative

-   effects : excessive amounts can cause muscular, cardiovascular, and renal damage.

-   usage : naturally occuring minium

-   metric : 0.7 mg/l

**Benzene** : negative

-   effects : carcinogenic substance that also affects central nervous system

-   usage : emission from motor vehicles mainly

**Benzoapyrene** : negative

-   effects : carcinogenic and mutagenic substance considered to be highly undesirable in drinking water, main exposure is through food.

-   usage : synthetic complete aromatic organic compound formed by combustion of organic materials.

**Beryllium** : negative

-   effects : toxic if inhaled, and can lead to variety of respiratory and other diseases.

-   usage : used in brass and alloys, particularly by aircraft and space industries

**Boron** : negative

-   effects : excessive amounts of boron can cause nervous problems

-   usage : naturally occurring trace element used in cleaning compounds and alloys

-   metric : typical is 5 mg/L w.r.t. seawater

**Bromate** : negative

-   effects : carcinogenic and mutagenic (dafuqq is the diff?)

-   usage : occurs when bromide present in water oxidized by agents, particularly **chloride**

**Cadmium** : negative

-   effects : highly toxic, severe restricutions on its concentratios in water; causes bone damage, chronic kidney disease, cancer, and hypertension.

-   usage : strongly absorbed in muds, humus and organic matter, entry into food chain via fish

**Calcium** : positive

-   effects : occurs in rocks, bones, shells; healthy

-   usage : existence

**Carbon\_Dioxide** : indicator

-   effects : n/a

-   usage : air, algal respiration; high levels enhances the effects of deoxygenation of high ammonia concentrations; excessive levels of carbon dioxide may have effects on aquatic life

-   personal comment : have to take this into account when looking at ammonia and fish levels if used for measuring water quality

**Chloride** : indicator

-   effects : no real risks, but high levels increase probability of pollution (sewers have more chloride)

-   usage : naturally occurring in waters

**Chlorophyll** : indicator

-   effects : no real effects

-   usage : naturally-occurring green pigment in algae, cyanobacteria, plants, vegetation

-   personal comment : indicates higher level of vegetation (what does vegetation do to quality?)

**Chromium** : negative

-   effects : toxic, but depends on the form it exists in

-   usage : naturally occurs in ore, but is also discharged from electroplating, tanning, textil, paint and dyeing plants.

-   personal comment : be cautious when using this as a measure, be sure that chromium form fits relative levels
