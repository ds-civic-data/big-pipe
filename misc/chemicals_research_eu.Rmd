Below is an overview of what makes water quality, by European water standards, standards 
that we should at least look at, if not adhere to : 

__Aluminum__ : negative  

- effects : pose danger to persons suffering from kidney disorders, and 
            causes neurological disorders 

- usage :
  the compound aluminium sulphate ("alum") is very widely used in
  water treatment to remove colour and non-filtrable matter in raw
  waters.

- metrics : recommended levels around 

__Ammonia__ : indicator  

- effects : indicates possibility of sewage pollution and consequent 
            possible presence of pathogenic micro-organisms
 
- usage : N/A 

- metrics : used in conjunction with chloride, because both are present
            in significant quantities in sewage.
            typical levels around 0.3 mg/L (limiting amount)

__Antimony__ : indicator 

- effects : indicaates possible pollution from metal industry 

- usage : naturally occurring trace element used in metal industry and in
          flame retardant materials. 

- metrics : typical level around 1 ug/L 

__Barium__ : negative 

- effects : excessive amounts can cause muscular, cardiovascular, and 
            renal damage. 

- usage : naturally occuring minium 

- metric : 0.7 mg/l 

__Benzene__ : negative 

- effects : carcinogenic substance that also affects central nervous 
            system 

- usage : emission from motor vehicles mainly 

__Benzoapyrene__ : negative 

- effects : carcinogenic and mutagenic substance considered to be highly 
            undesirable in drinking water, main exposure is through 
            food.

- usage : synthetic complete aromatic organic compound formed by 
          combustion of organic materials.  

__Beryllium__ : negative 

- effects : toxic if inhaled, and can lead to variety of respiratory and 
            other diseases. 

- usage : used in brass and alloys, particularly by aircraft and space 
          industries

__Boron__ : negative 

- effects : excessive amounts of boron can cause nervous problems 

- usage : naturally occurring trace element used in cleaning compounds 
          and alloys 

- metric : typical is 5 mg/L w.r.t. seawater 

__Bromate__ : negative  

- effects : carcinogenic and mutagenic (dafuqq is the diff?)

- usage : occurs when bromide present in water oxidized by agents, particularly **chloride**

__Cadmium__ : negative 

- effects : highly toxic, severe restricutions on its concentratios in 
            water; causes bone damage, chronic kidney disease, cancer, 
            and hypertension. 

- usage : strongly absorbed in muds, humus and organic matter, entry 
          into food chain via fish 

__Calcium__ : positive 

- effects : occurs in rocks, bones, shells; healthy 

- usage : existence 

__Carbon_Dioxide__ : indicator 

- effects : n/a  

- usage : air, algal respiration; high levels enhances the effects of deoxygenation of high ammonia concentrations; excessive levels of carbon dioxide may have effects on aquatic life 

- personal comment : have to take this into account when looking at 
                     ammonia and fish levels if used for measuring water
                     quality 

__Chloride__ : indicator 

- effects : no real risks, but high levels increase probability of 
            pollution (sewers have more chloride)

- usage : naturally occurring in waters

__Chlorophyll__ : indicator 

- effects : no real effects 

- usage : naturally-occurring green pigment in algae, cyanobacteria, 
            plants, vegetation 

- personal comment : indicates higher level of vegetation (what does 
                     vegetation do to quality?) 

__Chromium__ : negative 

- effects : toxic, but depends on the form it exists in 

- usage : naturally occurs in ore, but is also discharged from 
          electroplating, tanning, textil, paint and dyeing plants. 

- personal comment : be cautious when using this as a measure, be sure 
                     that chromium form fits relative levels
